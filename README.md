# Face_Recognition_based_attendance_system
This is the attendance project that will use web_cam to capture and detect the faces and records the attendance live in an excel sheet. When the new execution starts the attendance will be saved in the same excel sheet with a mention that the new execution has been started.
This is done using a face recognition library developed by Adam Geitgey which is able to pick out unique features of the face that you can use to tell it apart from other people. 
These features are then saved and finally compare the unique features of that face to all the people you already know to determine the personâ€™s name.
